This is a scan/OCR of Exhibits H and J from the Twitter v. Musk case, with some of the conversations de-interleaved and of course converted from a fuzzy scan to text to make for easier reading.

I did this so that I could easily read this and, after reading it, I've found that most accountings of what was said are, in one way or another, fairly misleading. Since the texts aren't all that long, if you're interested in what they said, [I would recommended that you just read the texts in their entirety](https://danluu.com/dunning-kruger/) (to the extent they're available — the texts make it clear that some parts of conversations are simply not included) instead of reading what various journalists excerpted, which seems to sometimes be deliberately misleading because selectively quoting allows them to write a story that matches their agenda and sometimes accidentally misleading because they don't know what's interesting about the texts.

If you want to compare these conversations to other executive / leadership conversations, you can compare them to [Microsoft emails and memos that came out of the DoJ case against Microsoft](https://danluu.com/us-v-ms/) and the [Enron email dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/).

Since this was done using OCR, it's likely there are OCR errors. Please feel free to [contact me](https://twitter.com/danluu/) if you see an error.

    *   **Alex Shillings \[IT specialist for SpaceX / Elon\]**: Elon- are you able to access your Twitter account ok? I saw a number of emails held in spam. Including some password resets attempts
    *   **Elon**: I haven't tried recently
    *   **Elon**: Am staying off twitter
    *   **Elon**: Is my twitter account posting anything?
    *   **Alex**: Not posting but I see one deactivation email and a dozen password reset emails. Assuming this is a scammer attempt but wanted to check to ensure you still had access to your Twitter
    *   **Elon**: It Is someone trying to hack my twitter
    *   **Elon**: But I have two-factor enabled with the confirmation app
    *   **Alex**: OK, great to hear.
    *   **Alex**: Yes -FaceTimed with them to confirm my identity(hah) and they are hopefully gonna reset your 2FA to SMS soon. Asking for an update now
    *   **Elon**: Sounds good
    *   **Elon**: I can also FaceTime with them if still a problem
    *   **Alex**: Tldr; your account is considered high profile internally over there. So they've made it very hard to make changes like this by their teams. They are working through it...
    *   **Elon**: Happy to FaceTime directly
    *   **Elon**: Not sure how I was able to make Twitter work on this new phone, as I didn't use the backup code.
    *   **Alex**: Connecting with their head of Trust & Safety now
    *   **Alex**: I assume we used your old phone to verify the new, once upon a time
    *   **Elon**: Oh yeah
    *   **Alex**: They can fix it by disabling all 2FA for your account which will let you in and then you can re-enable it. Are you available in 90 mins to have them coordinate it?
    *   **Elon**: \["liked" above\]
    *   **Alex**: I know things are in flux right now, but is EMDesk SpaceX still your primary calendar? I realize there a meeting on there in 1 hour. In case I should move this twitter fix out a bit.
    *   **Elon**: Yeah
    *   **Elon**: But I can step off the call briefly ta Face Time them if need be Alex: Sounds good. And ideally I'm just texting you ta sign in once they disable 2FA and then you can immediately sign in and re-enable. No FaceTime needed.
    *   **Elon**: \["liked" above\]
    *   **Alex**: Elon-we are ready to make the change if you are
    *   **Elon**: \["liked" above\]
    *   **Alex**: 2FA disabled. Please try to log in now
    *   **Alex**: Able to get back in ok?

    *   **Antonio Gracias \[VC\]**: Wow...I saw your tweet re free speech. Wtf is going on Elon...
    *   **Elon**: EU passed a law banning Russia Today and several other Russian news sources. We have been told to black their IP address.
    *   **Elon**: Actually, I find their news quite entertaining
    *   **Elon**: Lot of bullshit, but some good points too
    *   **Antonio**: This is fucking nuts...you are totally right. I 100% agree with you.
    *   **Elon**: We should allow it precisely be we hate it...that is the ping of the American constitution.
    *   **Antonio**: Exactly
    *   **Elon**: Free speech matters mast when it's someone you hate spouting what you think is bullshit.
    *   **Antonio**: I am 100% with you Elon. To the fucking mattresses no matter what .....this is a principle we need to fucking defend with our lives or we are lost to the darkness.

    *   **TJ**: can you buy Twitter and then delete it, please!? xx
    *   **TJ**: America is going INSANE.
    *   **TJ**: The Babylon Bee got suspension is crazy. Raiyah and I were talking about it today. It was a fucking joke. Why has everyone become so puritanical?
    *   **TJ**: Or can you buy Twitter and make it radically free-speech?
    *   **TJ**: So much stupidity comes from Twitter xx
    *   **Elon**: Maybe buy it and change it to properly support free speech xx
    *   **Elon**: \["liked" "Or can you buy Twitter..."\]
    *   **TJ**: I honestly think social media is the scourge of modern life, and the worst of all is Twitter, because it's also a news stream as well as a social platform, and so has more real-world standing than Tik Tok etc. But it's very easy to exploit and is being used by radicals for social engineering on a massive scale. And this shit is infecting the world. Please do do something to fight woke-ism. I will do anything to help! xx

Now I can cite you so I'll sound less crazy myself :). Our public squares need to not have arbitrary sketchy censorship.

    *   **\[2022-04-04\]**: Joe: Excited to see the stake in Twitter -awesome. "Back door man" they are saying haha. Hope you're able to influence it. I bet you the board doesn't even get full reporting or see any report of the censorship decisions and little cabals going on there but they should -the lefties on the board likely want plausible deniability !
    *   **Elon**: \["liked" above\]
    *   **\[2022-04-16\] Joe**: Haha even Governor DeSantis just called me just now with ideas how to help you and outraged at that board and saying the public is rooting for you. Let me know if you or somebody on your side wants to chat w him. Would be fun to see you if you guys are around this weekend or the next few days.
    *   **Elon**: Haha cool

    *   **"jack jack" \[presumably Jack Dorsey, former CEO of Twitter and CEO of Square\]**: Yes, a new platform is needed. It can't be a company. This is why I left.
    *   **jack**: [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1507777913042571267?s,=20&t=8z3h0h0JGSnt86Zuxd61Wg](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1507777913042571267?s,=20&t=8z3h0h0JGSnt86Zuxd61Wg)
    *   **Elon**: Ok
    *   **Elon**: What should it look like?
    *   **jack**: I believe it must be an open source protocol, funded by a foundation of sorts that doesn't own the protocol, only advances it. A bit like what Signal has done. It can't have an advertising model. Otherwise you have surface area that governments and advertisers will try to influence and control. If it has a centralized entity behind it, it will be attacked. This isn't complicated work, it just has to be done right so it's resilient to what has happened to twitter.
    *   **Elon**: Super interesting idea
    *   **jack**: I'm off the twitter board mid May and then completely out of company. I intend to do this work and fix our mistakes. Twitter started as a protocol. It should have never been a company. That was the original sin.
    *   **Elon**: I'd like to help if I am able to
    *   **jack**: I wanted to talk with you about it after I was all clear, because you care so much, get it's importance, and could def help in immeasurable ways. Back when we had the activist come in, I tried my hardest to get you on our board, and our board said no. That's about the time I decided I needed to work to leave, as hard as it was for me.
    *   **Elon**: \["loved" above\]
    *   **jack**: Do you have a moment to talk?
    *   **Elon**: Bout to head out to dinner but can for a minute
    *   **jack**: I think the main reason is the board is just super risk averse and saw adding you as more risk, which I thought was completely stupid and backwards, but I only had one vote, and 3% of company, and no dual class shares. Hard set up. We can discuss more.
    *   **Elon**: Let's definitely discuss more
    *   **Elon**: I think it's worth both trying to move Twitter in a better direction and doing something new that's decentralized
    *   **jack**: It's likely the best option. I just have doubts. But open

    *   **Elon**: Want to talk now?
    *   **Larry**: Sure.

    *   **Larry**: Yes ... of course 👍
    *   **Elon**: Cool
    *   **Elon**: Roughly what dollar size? Not holding you to anything, but the deal is oversubscribed, so I have to reduce or kick out some participants.
    *   **Larry**: A billion ... or whatever you recommend
    *   **Elon**: Whatever works for you. I'd recommend maybe $2B or more. This has very high potential and I'd rather have you than anyone else.
    *   **Larry**: I agree that it has huge potential... and it would be lots of fun
    *   **Elon**: Absolutely:)

    *   **Will MacAskill \[co-creator of effective altruism movement, Oxford professor, Chair of board for Global Priorities Institute at Oxford\]**: Hey - I saw your poll on twitter about Twitter and free speech. I'm not sure if this is what's on your mind, but my collaborator Sam Bankman-Fried ([https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam-bankman-fried/?sh=4de9866a4449](https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam-bankman-fried/?sh=4de9866a4449)) has for a while been potentially interested in purchasing it and then making it better for the world. If you want to talk with him about a possible joint effort in that direction, his number is \[redacted\] and he's on Signal.
    *   **Elon**: Does he have huge amounts of money?
    *   **Will**: Depends on how you define "huge"! He's worth $24B, and his early employees (with shared values) bump that to $30B. I asked about how much he could in principle contribute and he said: "~$1-3b would be easy-$3-8b I could do ~$8-15b is maybe possible but would require financing"
    *   **Will**: If you were interested to discuss the idea I asked and he said he'd be down to meet you in Austin
    *   **Will**: He's based in the Bahamas normally. And I might visit Austin next week, if you'd be around?
    *   **Will**: That's a start
    *   **Will**: Would you like me to intro you two via text?
    *   **Elon**: You vouch for him?

    *   **Will**: Great! Will use Signal
    *   **Will**: (Signal doesn't work; used imessage instead)

    *   **Mathias Döpfner \[CEO and 22% owner of Axel Springer, president of Federal Association of Digital Publishers and Newspaper Publishers\]**: Why don't you buy Twitter? We run it for you. And establish a true platform of free speech. Would be a real contribution to democracy.
    *   **Elon**: Interesting idea
    *   **Mathias**: I'm serious. It's doable. Will be fun.
    *   **\[2022-04-04\] Mathias**: Congrats to the Twitter invest! Fast execution 🤩 Shall we discuss wether we should join that project? I was serious with my suggestion.
    *   **Elon**: Sure, happy to talk
    *   **Mathias**: I am going to miami tomorrow for a week. Shall we speak then or Wednesday and take it from there?
    *   **Elon**: Sure
    *   **\[2022-04-06\] Mathias**: A short call about Twitter?
    *   **Mathias**: # Status Quo: It is the de facto public town square, but it is a problem that it does not adhere to free speech principles. => so the core product is pretty good, but (i) it does not serve democracy, and (ii) the current business model is a dead end as reflected by flat share price. # Goal: Make Twitter the global backbone of free speech, an open market place of ideas that truly complies with the spirit of the first amendment and shift the business model to a combination of ad-supported and paid to support quality # Game Plan: 1.),,Solve Free Speech" 1a) Step 1: Make it censorship-FREE by radically reducing Terms of Services (now hundreds of pages) to the following: Twitter users agree to: (1) Use our service to send spam or scam users, (2) Promote violence, (3) Post illegal pornography. 🙃 1b) Step 2: Make Twitter censorship-RESISTANT • Ensure censorship resistance by implementing measures that warrant that Twitter can't be censored long term, regardless of which government and management • How? Keep pushing projects at Twitter that have been working on developing a decentralized social network protocol (e.g., BlueSky). It's not easy, but the backend must run on decentralized infrastructure, APls should become open (back to the roots! Twitter started and became big with open APIs). • Twitter would be one of many clients to post and consume content. • Then create a marketplace for algorithms, e.g., if you're a snowflake and don't want content that offends you pick another algorithm. 2.) ,,Solve Share Price" Current state of the business: • Twitters ad revenues grow steadily and for the time being, are sufficient to fund operations. • MAUs are flat, no structural growth • Share price is flat, no confidence in the existing business model and/or
    *   **\[2022-04-14\] Mathias**: Our editor of Die Welt just gave an interview why he left Twitter. What he is criticising is exactly what you most likely want to change. I am thrilled to discuss twitters future when you are ready. So exciting.

You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vast majority of spam and bots. There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed.
    *   **Kimbal**: The second piece of the puzzle is a massive real-time database that keeps a copy of all blockchain messages in memory, as well as all message sent to or received by you, your followers and those you follow.
    *   **Kimbal**: Third piece is a twitter-like app on your phone that accessed the database in the cloud.

    *   **Elon**: Twrtter can't monetize video yet, so video is a loss for Twitter and for the those who post
    *   **Elon**: Twitter needs better guidance
    *   **Viv**: Yeah, 100%
    *   **Viv**: They should have a subscription that's actually useful (unlike Twitter Blue haha)

    *   **Elon to Bret Taylor**: I'd like to convey some critical elements of the transition plan. Is there a good time for us to talk tonight? Happy to have anyone from Twitter on the call.
    *   **Elon**: My biggest concern is headcount and expense growth. Twitter has ~3X the head count per unit of revenue of other social media companies, which is very unhealthy in my view.

    *   **Elon**: I don't have a Unkedln account
    *   **Elon**: I don't think we will have any CXO titles

    *   **Steve**: Ok, no management; good coders, got it.
    *   **Elon**: Yes
    *   **Elon**: Twitter is a software company (or should be)
    *   **Steve**: Yes. My son at Reddit and some other young people come to mind. I was thinking about who is going to manage the software people (to prioritize and hit deadlines), and I guess that's you.
    *   **Elon**: I will oversee software development

    *   **Michael**: Perfect.
    *   **Michael**: got it. Will forward the equity Interest email to Jared and Alex that he sent in and have It in the queue in the event his interest is needed overall. Absent the blockchain piece he's focused on investing if you want his interest in Twitter and your mission but we can park him for now.
    *   **Michael**: Agree. Was one piece of equation and I do think he would be at least3bn if you like him and want him, maybe more. Will work with Jared and Alex to be sure it makes sense to meet -my instinct is it does because Orlando Brace also declined today in the end (not sure if political fears or what but he fiaked today}.
    *   **\[2022-05-04\] Elon**: No response from Bret, not even an interest in talking. I think it's probably best to release the debt tomorrow. This might take a while.
    *   **Micahel Grimes**: Nikesh came to see me this afternoon. Just to talk Twitter and you. If you had the time he would cancel his plans tomorrow night to meet with you and come to where you are in SF or mid peninsula Or he could fly to Austin another time of course. If you want me to send him to you let me know and he will break his lans to do
    *   **Elon**: It's fine, no need to break his plans.
    *   **Michael**: Got it.
    *   **Michael**: I asked Pat and Kristina to each spend the weekend writing up their transition and diligence plan and how to approach debt rating agencies on may 16. We need one of them signed up (employment contract for 3 months) as Transition CFO of X Holdings and owning the model and diligence from financial point of view on the follow up meetings with Twitter on costs and users and engineers etc. We believe two will not work at the agencies or in front of debt investors as you have to have one CFO. If you were willing to have SVP Ops of X Holdings (Pat would be more qualified for that than Kristina I then it's possible to retain them both for the transition. The way to stay on ludicrous speed Is to pick one of them tomorrow as transition CFO and then we run with it full metal jacket. I believe each can do the job and deliver the ratings and debt and transition plan for day one. Then you dismiss him/her as job well done or offer permanent CFO if you choose.
    *   **Elon**: Neither were great.
    *   **Elon**: They asked no good questions and had no good comments.
    *   **Elon**: Let's slow down just a few days
    *   **Elon**: Putin's speech tomorrow is extremely important
    *   **Elon**: It won't make sense to buy Twitter if we're headed into WW3
    *   **Elon**: Just sayin
    *   **Michael**: Understood. If the pace stays rapid each are good enough to get job done for the debt Then you hire great for go forward. But will pause for May 9 Vladimir and hope for the best there. We can take stock of where things look after that.
    *   **Elon**: \["liked" above\]
    *   **Elon**: An extremely fundamental due diligence item is understanding exactly how Twitter confims that 95% of their daily active users are both real people and not double-counted.
    *   **Elon**: They couldn't answer that on Friday, which is insane.
    *   **Elon**: If that number is more like 50% or lower, which is what I would guess based on my feed, then they have been fundamentally misrepresenting the value of Twitter to advertisers and investors.
    *   **Elon**: To be super clear, this deal moves forward if it passes due diligence, but obviously not if there are massive gaping issues.
    *   **Elon**: True user account is a showstopper if actually much lower than the 95% claimed
    *   **Elon**: Parag said thatTwitter has 2500 coders doing at least 100 lines per month. Maybe they could fit this feature in ...

    *   **Jason**: one thing you can do in this regard is an SPV of 250 folks capped at $10m .. pain on the next for a large company but one item on cap table

    *   **\[redacted\]**: If I understood them correctly, Ned \[presumebly Ned Segal, CFO of Twitter\] and Parag said that cash expenditures over the next 12 months will be $78 and that cash receipts will also be $78. However, the cash receipts number doesn't seem realistic, given that they expect only $1.2B in CU, which is just $4.8B annualized.
    *   **\[redacted\]**: In europe so just getting your msg. i do not have proxy w me but my guess is they are using their proxy numbers vs current reality. we are developing proformas that have lower revenue/receipts and lower disbursements.
    *   **Elon**: Ok. Given that Q2 is almost over, itobviousl doesn't make sense for them to use proxy numbers vs \[looks like something is cut off here — seems like text is in a spreadsheet and word wrap wasn't used on this row, which was then printed and scanned in\]
    *   **Elon**: I'm traveling in Europe right now, but back next week
    *   **\[redacted\]**: i spokewned on the 7b receipts/expenses. he said he was trying to be more illustrative on '23 expense base, pre any actions we would take and provide a simplified strawman of possible savings. he said they are not planning on doing an updated fcst for 22/23. i think this Is ok re process since i think their fcst would not likely be very good and we wouldn't likely use It anyways. They fly at way too high a level to have a fcst of much value. We are in process of developing revenue fcst and a range of sensitivities and will then walk thru w them to get their input.
    *   **Elon**: Their revenue projections seem disconnected from reality
    *   **\[redacted\]**: completely.
